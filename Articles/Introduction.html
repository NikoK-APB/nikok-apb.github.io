<h1 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33">Introduction!</font></h1>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Hello! You're probably new here. How about 
  a lil' tour? :3</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33">Who?</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">I'm Niko! Niko Kailihiwa. I run this quaint 
  little site. I love talking about music so I thought I'd make a silly lil' blog 
  site just in case somebody discovers this site and wants to read the junk I 
  have to say about random albums!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">It 's also important you know my general 
  taste in music, so you can smell out any biases I may have towards an album. 
  I'm primarily a rock/metal kitty :3. I do occasionally branch out and enjoy 
  other genres of music, but rock/metal has always been my main bread and butter, 
  ya hear?</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33">What?</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">This is Album Pirate's Blog, silly! It's 
  called that because most of the albums I listen to are pirated ;3c (please don't 
  tell) and APB is just a cool acronym, is it not?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">While it is <i>technically</i> a review 
  site, it's really more of a blog (it's in the name ya know). As such, I don't 
  have review scores! Well... kinda, There will be a lil' picture of Niko from 
  OneShot up in the corner to sorta gague my general feeling of an album. But 
  please please <i>please</i> listen to the album that I'm talking about while 
  you're reading my articles and form your <b>own</b> opinion, `kay? Music's basically 
  free to listen now, so get listening!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Oh! One last thing in this section, feel 
  free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:apb.nikok@gmail.com">email</a> and we can 
  chat more there! I'd enjoy talking with anybody about music. Obviously <b>as 
  long as you're respectful</b>. C'mon people it's not <i>that</i> hard, 'kay? 
  'Kay. :3</font></p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FFFF33">Why?</font></h2>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">As I said before, I made this site to blab 
  on and on about random albums I wanna talk about! I like talking about music 
  and I want other people to hear about it instead of bombarding my friends text 
  messages with random knowledge about random albums.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Oh, and another reason is I like old website 
  designs! I don't know why I do! I just do! And for maximum authenticity, I'm 
  making this website on an iBook G3 with a copy of Dreamweaver 4 on Mac OS 9! 
  Talk about obsolete! I really hope the hard drive doesn't die on me... Oh wait! 
  I can upload everything to an FTP server! No issues there then! Yay!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Anyways, welcome to my website! Hope you 
  enjoy reading the nonsense I have to say about whatever music I wanna talk about! 
  :3</font></p>
