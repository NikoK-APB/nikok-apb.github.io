<p align="left">You&#146;re here! This is quite literally the first article, post, 
  blog, whatever you wanna call it on my silly lil&#146; website! Anyways, I didn&#146;t 
  want to review one of my favorite albums, &#145;cause that&#146;s stinky, lame, 
  and boring! So how about Antipop by Primus?</p>
<p align="left">I&#146;ve actually been wanting to talk about this album for a 
  while since I first listened to it a couple years ago as the story around the 
  album and how this particular album fits in with the rest of the band&#146;s 
  discography is sorta interesting, at least to me anyways.</p>
<p align="left">So lets get on with the background, this was Primus&#146; last 
  album before they went on a bit of a hiatus, not releasing another album till 
  2011 (for reference, Antipop released in 2011). This album is sorta to blame 
  for their hiatus since Les Claypool said that the band had &#147;...reached 
  the end of our creative rope.&#148; when it came to making this album. In fact, 
  Claypool has gone onto say that it&#146;s his least favorite Primus album. And 
  that there was a lot of tension between the band members when producing the 
  album, and that the closest they came to breaking up as a band was because of 
  Antipop!</p>
<p align="left">Boy, this album sounds like a freaking disaster, huh? Well, you&#146;re 
  probably looking at my reaction in the corner. And indeed, it&#146;s no St. 
  Anger or something stupid like that. It&#146;s actually... Listenable? It&#146;s 
  also... Not bad? What?! Yeah, spoiler alert the album isn&#146;t actually horrible. 
  Now I&#146;m sure some of the credit for this falls on the producers of the 
  album. Yes, producers. The list of producers includes Primus themselves, Tom 
  Morello, Stewart Copeland, Tom Waits, Matt Stone, and finally... Fred Durst... 
  Urgh.</p>
<p align="left">Anyways, onto the music! How is it? Well let&#146;s start at the 
  first track...</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Intro</font></h2>
<p>It&#146;s... It&#146;s just some sample that sounds like it was played in reverse, 
  then a raspy voice says &#147;1, 2, 3&#148; and then the next track...</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Electric Uncle Sam</font></h2>
<p>Starts. See what I did there? Huh? I&#146;m playing with the format of this 
  article :3 Anyways... This is the first track produced by Tom Morello. And I 
  think this is a good track to open up an album on! It&#146;s got a good intro 
  and it really sets you up for what this album has to offer! A more... Commercially 
  heavy version of Primus than we&#146;ve heard before, if that makes sense. In 
  fact that&#146;s Tom Morello on the guitar. And one thing about Primus is there&#146;s 
  always been more of an emphasis on the bass guitar rather than lead/rhythm guitar 
  (except some KILLER solos from Ler). But in the tracks where Tom Morello is 
  playing, it&#146;s his guitar that&#146;s sorta &#147;stealing the show&#148; 
  in my opinion. But that doesn&#146;t really matter. It&#146;s overall a pretty 
  decent track with a catchy chorus and some admittedly light slap bass work. 
  C&#146;mon Les, step it up!</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Natural Joe</font></h2>
<p>This is the track produced by South Park co-creator Matt Stone. And both South 
  Park creators were fans of Primus and got them to compose the South Park opening 
  song. Anyways, I mention that because I can imagine Stone telling Claypool: 
  &#147;Hey, I really like Harold of the Rocks, you should make a song kinda similar 
  to that&#148;. And that&#146;s Natural Joe! It&#146;s a song that tells a story 
  about some guy in a similar manner to Harold of the Rocks. Except Les Claypool 
  says &#147;bitch-a&#148; a lot and it&#146;s about a guy that goes out to buy 
  Scotch and porn, lovely. Still a good track though, and I got my beloved slap 
  bass back! And some pretty good drumming by Brain at the end of the song.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Lacquer Head</font></h2>
<p>This is the track produced by... Fred Worst... Ugh... This track is gonna be 
  HORRIBLE, isn&#146;t it? Well, it was the album&#146;s leading single, and the 
  only track from this album that got a music video so... Who knows? Lemme give 
  it a listen.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>WHAT THE FREAK FRED DURST DOESN&#146;T RUIN EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES?!?! Yeah! 
  Apparently he&#146;s also a fan of Primus! Apparently all he really did was 
  encourage the band to go back to their more aggressive roots from Frizzle Fry 
  or Sailing The Seas of Cheese. There was probably more done than just that but 
  apparently it resurrected the band&#146;s enthusiasm, so that&#146;s good! And 
  you can hear it too, this does sound more like a song that Primus actually wanted 
  to make while still feeling like it belongs on Antipop (spoiler alert: a pretty 
  directionless album). Lacquer Head might be the song that defined the sound 
  of this album, but I don&#146;t know I&#146;m just guessing.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">The Antipop</font></h2>
<p>This song is one of the more experimental songs on this album. And... I like 
  it! A lot! It&#146;s always been a standout track to me and has become my favorite 
  track off this album, so I may be biased. I love the kinda creepy sounding intro 
  and I really don&#146;t mind how long it goes on for either, I&#146;m a freakin&#146; 
  TOOL fan after all! The most interesting part of this track is that it sounds 
  like it laid the groundwork for one of Les Claypool&#146;s side projects during 
  Primus&#146; hiatus: Oysterhead. Seriously, while listening to this song I couldn&#146;t 
  help but shake the feeling that the intro to this track sounds like something 
  straight off of The Grand Pecking Order. Once Les yells out &#147;I think I&#146;m 
  blinded by the sun!&#148; it does go back to that good &#145;ol Antipop sound 
  though. Great track though! Still my favorite off this album.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Greet the Sacred Cow</font></h2>
<p>I&#146;ll be honest. Starting with this song, the album starts to get a little 
  boring. Well, by Primus standards anyways. I&#146;m honestly not really sure 
  what this song is supposed to be about. My best guess is that it&#146;s about 
  someone who wants special treatment since they have cancer and will only live 
  another year? I honestly have no idea. Either that or it&#146;s making fun of 
  cancer treatment, which... Why would you make fun of that? Let me do some searching...</p>
<p>So, some say it&#146;s about man made religion, or the song&#146;s talking 
  about apocalypse cults, or it&#146;s a message to think for yourself. I have 
  no idea, the only one that probably isn&#146;t right is the apocalypse cult 
  one... And my theory too. Who knows, it&#146;s not like every Primus song makes 
  a ton of sense (like Frizzle Fry, excellent song though :3).</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Mama Didn&#146;t Raise No Fool</font></h2>
<p>Hey, who the hell put a Rage Against The Machine song on this album? Ohhhh... 
  That&#146;s just Tom Morello playing, okay. In fact, looking into the lyrics 
  it almost looks like a RATM song too! Like it was some kinda unused material 
  Tom Morello that Primus decided to adapt. The song&#146;s about how the government 
  is, get this, corrupt. And, get this too, is out of touch. I know, bold statements 
  only here on APB. And the &#147;protagonist&#148; of this song is &#147;not 
  a fool&#148; and is aware of both of these issues in society. If it was unused 
  RATM material, I sure as hell see why, it&#146;s just a kinda &#147;grass is 
  green&#148; type of political song. Then again, I guess Primus never really 
  leaned hard into political songs, they&#146;ve only dabbled in it. Or I just 
  haven&#146;t noticed their other political songs :p.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Dirty Drowning Man</font></h2>
<p>This song always went in one ear and out the other for me personally. This 
  song seems to be something about true friends and such. I think the song is 
  about that one really weird friend you have that makes no sense but will always 
  stick by your side and help you out when you&#146;re at your lowest. While that 
  friend is ALSO dealing with their own issues and wants somebody to return the 
  favor to them. Some other people online have also stated it&#146;s a song about 
  the band and how Primus is the &#147;dirty drowning man&#148; but eh, I don&#146;t 
  really know. This is another weird song.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Ballad of Bodacious</font></h2>
<p>The silly song!!! This song&#146;s about... A bull, a bull named Bodacious. 
  I&#146;m not even kidding. This song is most similar to say... Fisticuffs or 
  Golden Boy from Brown Album. Or even Mrs. Blaileen from Punchbowl. As in all 
  of those songs are purely just a story. But Ballad of Bodacious is literally 
  a song about a bucking bull and then he breaks every bone in Tuff Hedeman&#146;s 
  face (true story too). Now, the thing about this song is it doesn&#146;t have 
  much to it, y&#146;know? You can really feel the band grasping for any creativity 
  left on this song with the lyrics, it just kinda repeats itself after the Tuff 
  Hedeman verse. The other &#147;Primus story&#148; songs didn&#146;t really have 
  this issue, at least not that I remember anyways. Still not a bad song but... 
  It&#146;s not all that.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Power Mad</font></h2>
<p>What the hell kinda intro is that? And who the hell even said that? And can 
  I meet him cause we have something in common...</p>
<p>Ahem, anyways. I&#146;m at a loss. Seriously, I don&#146;t really know what 
  this song&#146;s supposed to be about. The first verse suggests the song&#146;s 
  about desensitizing everyone and broadcasting war on TV. And then the chorus 
  is about a play actor who just sucks but they have big ambitions of becoming 
  a real star. I have no idea how those two are connected in anyway to be honest. 
  Oh, and welcome back Tom Morello, once again de-emphasizing the bass guitar. 
  Okay I&#146;m not hating on Tom over here, but I&#146;ve noticed that the focus 
  is usually placed more on his guitar whenever he&#146;s playing. Either that 
  or Les&#146; bass riffs aren&#146;t as interesting anymore. Probably because 
  I&#146;m just used to them, cause it&#146;s still complex and whatnot, just 
  not as crazy as other Primus songs. Overall, okay song.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">The Final Voyage of the Liquid Sky</font></h2>
<p>Okay, we&#146;re back. This sounds like a good heavy Primus song! And the lyrics 
  too! They make no sense but in a classic Primus kinda way, y&#146;know? I hope 
  I don&#146;t sound like a hypocrite. Now, the song is likely a metaphor for 
  something but it also just sounds like a song about fishies in the ocean hehehe 
  yayyyy fishy :3. Maybe it&#146;s about a brine pool? With the way it&#146;s 
  talking about clambering over corpses. Maybe, I don&#146;t actually know. Some 
  say it&#146;s a metaphor for going against the grain again &#147;I&#146;ve been 
  fightin&#146; gravity since I was two&#148;. Or that the song&#146;s about how 
  people will fuck you over to be the &#147;chosen one&#148;. I don&#146;t know, 
  I still prefer my fish theory :3. Good song! With good bass.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Coattails of a Dead Man</font></h2>
<p>The Courtney Love song! I&#146;m kidding, it&#146;s probably not about that. 
  Or it probably is. Primus themselves never confirmed nor denied it apparently 
  so... Yeah it&#146;s up to speculation. Looking at the lyrics though, it&#146;s 
  definitely at least inspired by Kurt Cobain&#146;s story, but definitely not 
  directly based around it, if that makes sense. The song is about a man who marries 
  a gold digger woman that just isn&#146;t good for him. And when he reaches out 
  for comfort from his wife, she basically gave him the middle finger then the 
  man killed himself. After that, the wife finds profit in her husband&#146;s 
  death and takes full advantage of that. About the only real Kurt Cobain comparisons 
  that are there in the song are the &#147;...he wasn&#146;t looking for fanfare 
  or fame. But it all came around just the same.&#148; and &#147;...two barrels 
  of steel.&#148; lyrics. Aside from that? It&#146;s just a song about an attention 
  seeking gold-digger. And what a good damn song it is too. It tells an interesting 
  story that doesn&#146;t repeat itself like Bodacious. And the music is both 
  unique from this album while also sounding just like Primus. No wonder it&#146;s 
  Les&#146; favorite song off this album! And they definitely saved the best for 
  last with this album, it&#146;s a great way to send off after a few pretty &#147;eh&#148; 
  songs. Again, by Primus standards.</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">The Heckler</font></h2>
<p>Wait, what? That&#146;s not the end? Nope! There&#146;s a bonus track! And 
  this track actually originates from Primus&#146; first ever release, Suck on 
  this, from back in 1989. Short story, it&#146;s just a live album and most of 
  those songs made it onto Frizzle Fry and Seas of Cheese. And then Pressman landed 
  on Pork Soda, and finally The Heckler landed here, on Antipop (Jellikit is still 
  hanging out in Suck on This limbo, however). I feel like Primus put this on 
  here for the fans, &#145;cause I honestly don&#146;t see it fitting anywhere 
  else on the album. And with it being one of two songs from Suck on This that 
  didn&#146;t have a studio version yet, it feels like a treat for any super fan 
  that sat through the entirety of Antipop. Anyways, the song, is it any good? 
  Hell yeah it&#146;s great! It&#146;s obviously gonna have a more classic Primus 
  sound since... It literally is a classic Primus song. I think they did the right 
  thing putting it on Antipop though, I don&#146;t see it fitting on their other 
  albums personally. And while I also didn&#146;t see it fitting super well on 
  Antipop anyways, it still manages to sound like it belongs on this album at 
  the same time. It&#146;s weird, but it&#146;s a great song that deserves to 
  be on here!</p>
<h2 align="center"><font color="#FCF434">Conclusion</font></h2>
<p>So, I may have been a little hard on some of the songs but here&#146;s the 
  thing about Antipop, it&#146;s not like offensive or anything. And surely doesn&#146;t 
  deserve to be written off entirely. The worst Antipop song is just kinda forgettable 
  and the best songs are actually really really good. I honestly remember this 
  album more than Brown Album or even Punchbowl... I&#146;m sorry. The whole of 
  the album is a little directionless, but it doesn&#146;t feel totally lost either. 
  The &#147;directionless&#148; feeling was most likely a product of all the different 
  producers and artists helping out on the album (it&#146;s actually the same 
  issue that Oysterhead had in my opinion). It&#146;s one of those things where 
  the album is still pretty good, it&#146;s just not as good by the band&#146;s 
  standards, y&#146;know? It&#146;s absolutely worth a listen, well, you were 
  supposed to be listening to it while you were reading this anyways if you read 
  my introduction over on the left but oh well! I can&#146;t control you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you got to the end of this, let me know! Shoot me an <a href="mailto:apb.nikok@gmail.com">email</a> 
  and tell me what I did wrong, I&#146;m new to this whole writing thing. Anyways, 
  hope ya read whatever other junk I have to write later! See ya!</p>
